House poll: Obaseki frets as National Assembly election defeat unsettles governor,"With the woeful performance of the Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State in the February 25 presidential and National Assembly elections, ADEYINKA ADEDIPE writes that the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has hit the streets soliciting votes as the popularity of his party dwindles in the state
The battle for the soul of the Edo State House of Assembly has become fierce as two political heavyweights in the state, Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party and his predecessor, Adams Oshiomhole of the All Progressives Congress, are locked in a battle of wits. They are both campaigning vigorously to earn their parties enough votes to control the 24-member Assembly.
With the governorship election not taking place in the state until 2024, it has become more important for the governor to ensure he gets majority-seats in the assembly to avert any impeachment move.
The governor, whose party failed to win any of the National Assembly seats or deliver the state to the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in the presidential and National Assembly elections on February 25, knows he has to double his efforts if he intends to get the majority in the state assembly, which is looking unlikely considering the voting pattern in the last election, where the APC dominated in Edo North and Edo Central while the Labour Party candidates held sway in Edo South, while the PDP finished a distant third in the presidential poll.
 
All hope is not lost, as the state PDP, headed by the governor, is making efforts to reverse the situation.
However, the lukewarm attitude of the Legacy Group, led by PDP Vice Chairman South-South, Dan Orbih, towards the election may have greatly contributed to the poor showing of the party. What is clear is that this week is crucial for the governor and his faction.
Obaseki has taken his campaign to the markets and streets to tell the traders and residents about the need to vote for his party in the March 18 election, noting that achieving this would help him continue the development of the state.      
However, some traders have not bought his idea, as he was greeted with chants of Obi (the LP presidential candidate) when he went to the Uwelu spare parts market recently. He was eventually granted an audience after frayed nerves were calmed. However, he had a better reception in some other markets he took his campaign to, which could be a good sign for the candidates of his party in the March 18 election.
On the other hand, the emergence of Oshiomhole as the Edo North representative in the Senate appears to have galvanised the APC, which was before now doing poorly as the main opposition party in the state. Having secured Edo North and floored the Deputy Governor, Comrade Philip Shaibu, who is from the same local government area as the former APC national leader, in the February 25 election, Oshiomhole relocated to Benin, the state capital, where he has continued to campaign at markets and open spaces. Wherever he went, he was met by an enthusiastic crowd that chanted his name. What Oshiomhole has going for him is the way he captivates the crowd and holds them spellbound with his energy and rhetoric.
Adding to the fierce battle is the acrimony generated by the exclusion of 14 APC members from the assembly in 2019 and the fallout between the governor and Oshiomhole, which led to the APC denying Obaseki a second-term ticket. Obaseki defected to the PDP, where he realised his second-term ambition.
As expected, both camps are firing salvos at each other as they are locked in a battle of words and wit.
The Special Adviser to the Edo State Governor on Media Projects, Crusoe Osagie, in a statement, said moves by Oshiomhole on the House of Assembly poll exposed his (Oshiomhole’s) insidious plan to oust Governor Obaseki through impeachment.
Osagie expressed confidence that the Edo people, as they did in 2020, would again rise in defence of the governor at the polls on March 18 and vote massively for the PDP by electing a House controlled by the PDP.
Osagie said, “The recent statement by the former Edo State Governor, Adams Oshiomhole, on the fate of Governor Godwin Obaseki in the Edo State House of Assembly polls exposes his insidious plan to oust the current governor through impeachment.        
“We are, however, confident that, as it happened in 2020 when Edo people stood with the governor despite the bullying and intimidation by Oshiomhole and his paymasters, Edo people will again rise in defence of the governor at the polls on Saturday, March 18, vote massively for the PDP, and elect a House controlled by the party.
“Obaseki has never placed his confidence in any man or godfather. He has placed his confidence in God and the people.”
However, Victor Oshioke, the Chief Media Aide to Oshiomhole, said Obaseki was scared of the looming consequences of his reign of terror.
He said, “Godwin Obaseki is a corrosive politician whose attitudes are patently leprous. He contaminates and destroys any party, place, or person that he associates with. For almost seven years, he governed Edo State like Herod, insensitive to the aspirations, frustrations, and cries of the people who elected him.
“But on February 25, 2023, the Edo people unambiguously rejected him and his PDP faction in the presidential, Senate, and House of Representatives polls. For the first time since the return to democracy in 1999, the Edo State PDP failed to win any seats in the national assembly, a direct consequence of Godwin Obaseki’s cantankerous, vicious, and reckless use of state power to intimidate, oppress, terrorise, and pauperise our people.

“On March 18, Edo people will once again go to the poll to put the final nail in the coffin of impunity, hatred, insecurity, maladministration, destruction of private properties, economic retrogression, infrastructural decay, and disrespect for traditional institutions, which are the unfortunate hallmarks of Godwin Obaseki’s two tenures in office.
“No man is God, and Oshiomhole is not God. He has never pretended to have godly powers, so he cannot install or decree who becomes a member of the House of Assembly. That is for the electorate to do. But as a leader, Oshiomhole is calling on all Edo people to come out and vote for all APC candidates so that true democracy can once again be restored in Edo State.”      
To also underline the importance of the assembly election to the Labour Party, its presidential standard bearer, Peter Obi, was in Edo State on Saturday to drum up support for the party’s candidates. The LP candidates did well in the Edo South axis in the February 25 election, and the party would prefer that he also get the majority in the assembly as a prelude to the ultimate battle in the governorship election in 2024.
While speaking to party supporters and residents, Obi urged them to remain resilient and focused despite his loss at the polls. He also called for support for all the LP candidates in the House of Assembly election, noting that the wave of change sweeping across the country cannot be stopped by anyone.
Also, the state LP chairman, Kelly Ogbaloi, denied vehemently that the party is working with the PDP in the assembly election, describing news that made the rounds recently as “mere rumour.”
Obi said, “I must urge the Labour Party supporters not to be discouraged by the outcome of the presidential election.
Nigeria must not be allowed to remain the way it is. There must be a paradigm shift from the present state to a better and a prosperous Nigeria.
“We have begun the journey of a new Nigeria. The movement is real, and nobody can stop it. We will not allow Nigeria to remain the way it is. We will continue to vote for the Labour Party.”
Despite this high-powered ‘politicking’ between the parties, especially the PDP and APC, the Edo State Chapter of the Civil Society Organisations called on the electorate to vote credible candidates into the state House of Assembly and resist any attempt to impose candidates on the people.  
A Marxist, Kola Edokpayi, who spoke on behalf of the group, described Saturday’s election as an exercise between the oppressed people of the state and those in power.
He said, “The March 18 election is an exercise between the oppressed people of Edo State and those in power who have used anti-people’s policies to render the masses impotent, helpless, and make them refugees in their land of birth.
“Edo people cannot continue to be governed by the likes of King Pharaoh, Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, and Idi Amin, who adopted the principle of Niccolo Machiavelli that the end justifies the means.
“This time around, we need a robust state House of Assembly that can represent the interests of the entire Edo people and not a rubber stamp assembly tied to the apron string of the executive.”
Edokpayi also pointed out that the election would awaken the consciousness of the people that power belongs to God and the people.
He said, “We are using this opportunity to call on the Edo people to vote credible people into the House of Assembly in the state. The recent political proceedings in Nigeria are a lucid transmogrification of the political status quo since 1960, when political vampires imposed their stooges on the people.
“The March 18 election is another milestone in the history of Nigeria where Edo people will come out en masse to express their displeasure and dissatisfaction with the pattern of governance over time and vote for their representatives who will represent their interests in the Parliament.      
“Those who want to represent us should be people with character and vision, as well as the courage to speak truth to power no matter whose ox is gored. I appeal to security agencies to protect lives and properties before, during, and after the election. Any attempt by an individual, a group of individuals, or the government or government agents to manipulate and subvert the will of the people would be resisted.”
It is surprising, however, to see that the governor is battling very hard to appeal to the same people who voted for him massively almost three years ago. What is certain is that the battle for the soul of the state House of Assembly will go down to the wire.",0.05419648869648871,Positive,"All hope is not lost, as the state PDP, headed by the governor, is making efforts to reverse the situation.

Despite this high-powered ‘politicking’ between the parties, especially the PDP and APC, the Edo State Chapter of the Civil Society Organisations called on the electorate to vote credible candidates into the state House of Assembly and resist any attempt to impose candidates on the people.  
A Marxist, Kola Edokpayi, who spoke on behalf of the group, described Saturday’s election as an exercise between the oppressed people of the state and those in power.
He said, “The March 18 election is an exercise between the oppressed people of Edo State and those in power who have used anti-people’s policies to render the masses impotent, helpless, and make them refugees in their land of birth.
“Edo people cannot continue to be governed by the likes of King Pharaoh, Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, and Idi Amin, who adopted the principle of Niccolo Machiavelli that the end justifies the means.
“This time around, we need a robust state House of Assembly that can represent the interests of the entire Edo people and not a rubber stamp assembly tied to the apron string of the executive.”
Edokpayi also pointed out that the election would awaken the consciousness of the people that power belongs to God and the people.
He said, “We are using this opportunity to call on the Edo people to vote credible people into the House of Assembly in the state. The recent political proceedings in Nigeria are a lucid transmogrification of the political status quo since 1960, when political vampires imposed their stooges on the people.
“The March 18 election is another milestone in the history of Nigeria where Edo people will come out en masse to express their displeasure and dissatisfaction with the pattern of governance over time and vote for their representatives who will represent their interests in the Parliament.      
“Those who want to represent us should be people with character and vision, as well as the courage to speak truth to power no matter whose ox is gored. I appeal to security agencies to protect lives and properties before, during, and after the election. Any attempt by an individual, a group of individuals, or the government or government agents to manipulate and subvert the will of the people would be resisted.”
It is surprising, however, to see that the governor is battling very hard to appeal to the same people who voted for him massively almost three years ago. What is certain is that the battle for the soul of the state House of Assembly will go down to the wire.",0.05568132400324182,Positive,,

"In true democracies, political structures don’t win elections","Despite the shortcomings of the 2023 presidential election, which were seemingly deliberately created by the Independent National Electoral Commission, the election has given some power to the masses and created some fear in Nigerian politicians. If INEC had kept its word of organising a completely transparent election in which all results at polling units were electronically transmitted and collated without any alteration, it would have revolutionised elections in Nigeria by returning power fully to the people as demanded by democracy.
Notwithstanding that, it gave Nigerian politicians a taste of what true democracy is: government of the people by the people and for the people. Especially in the federal legislative elections where INEC allowed elections to be electronically transmitted, many power brokers were defeated by political Lilliputians in different parts of the country. This has made those contesting the upcoming governorship and state legislative elections to become humble. Many of them have been seen kneeling down or prostrating before the people to beg for forgiveness, or visiting unusual locations and performing amusing acts, to prove that they are people-oriented politicians. Those who taunted the masses or dismissed them as social media tigers have changed their tune.
Last week, the world celebrated the International Women’s Day for 2023. But for Nigerian women, 2023 has not brought good news in politics. Even though election was declared inconclusive in some of the senatorial zones, results of the February 25 election show that only three women may be at the Senate, which features 109 members. That is a drop from the eight female senators inaugurated in the current ninth Senate in June 2019, out of which Senator Rose Oko of Cross River died and was replaced by a man.
Two of the seven senators that will not be part of the Senate from 2023 to 2027 are from Anambra State, which has been producing the highest number of female senators since the Fourth Republic commenced in 1999. They are Senators Uche Ekwunife and Stella Oduah.
 
Until the February 25 election, the most powerful female grassroots politician in Nigeria was Senator Ekwunife, representing Anambra Central Senatorial Zone. This is not an exaggeration. There are facts to back up that claim.
Ekwunife had her Anambra Central Senatorial Zone under lock and key. Whether you are a man, a woman or a demi-god, she would floor you in any election, no matter your chains of degree or wealth or influence. She facilitated many projects for her zone, and the people loved her. If not for the rotation of the governorship position among the three zones of Anambra State, she would have contested the seat in 2021 and probably won it.
Ekwunife with Senator Stella Oduah from Anambra North Senatorial Zone gave Anambra the record of the state that has produced the highest number of back-to-back female senators. With both of them, Anambra was producing more female senators than some zones in Nigeria that have six or seven states. Despite the disadvantage women have in Nigerian politics, it was only in Anambra State that female senators had the upper hand over men and were sure of defeating men without the backing of any political godfather.      
Then hubris came upon Ekwunife and she took unwarranted swipes at the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr Peter Obi, referring to him as “a kindergarten president” and his supporters as “mobocracy.” Oduah was also accused of working against the presidential ambition of Obi during the primaries by ensuring that the Anambra delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party were under the control of Nyesom Wike, who was in the race with Obi and others. With his home base taken away from him, Obi left the PDP.
Note that these ladies were not contesting against Obi. Obi did not say anything against them. They didn’t even have to say anything against Obi during the campaign. But like most Nigerian politicians who don’t know how to read situations, they couldn’t see that the ship had left the harbour. In the estimation of most Nigerian politicians and Nigerian voters, there are power brokers who own Nigerian politics and determine who wins any election.  Related News   February elections consolidated Nigeria’s democracy, Presidency replies critics  Presidential poll: Obi makes U-turn, says he'll challenge process, outcome  Election: God's wish is doing right thing, says Obi   
Then came February 25. And the people spoke. The people did not just speak: they thundered! Their noise reverberated and propelled Ekwunife and Oduah out of their senatorial seats. For a political tigress who had defeated many heavyweights before, Ekwunife could not even get the second position in the election. The people showed that power belongs to them and not to power brokers with structures.
Meanwhile, Senator Victor Umeh, former Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, who had worked against Obi some years ago, had read the handwriting on the wall and smartly reconciled with Obi, picking the LP ticket for Anambra Central, which Ekwunife had collected from him. By going to Obi and joining the little-known LP, he finally was able to wrest the Senate seat from Ekwunife. And he took the ticket so easily this time. Umeh must have been shocked that what was so difficult for him to achieve for a while became like a piece of cake just because he aligned with Obi at a time no top South-East politician wanted to openly align with him.
Interestingly, if the governorship position of Anambra State were up for election on Saturday, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo would have been overwhelmingly voted out, despite his huge popularity barely one year ago when he contested the position. He would have been punished for the condescension, malice and ridicule he expressed in his needless November 2022 letter against Obi and his supporters. Like other politicians, the argument of Soludo was simple: Obi had no political structure and could not win the presidency; the best he could do would be to win in one state.
Before the February 25 election, many “political pundits” emphasised the importance of political structure as the determinant of election victory. They dismissed Labour Party as lacking in structure and therefore unable to pose any threat. Interestingly, even though the presidential election result was flawed and has been the subject of legal contest, Labour Party denied the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party the 25-percent vote score in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory.
For the first time, LP has made it come up as a factor for the court to determine if a presidential candidate needs to win at least 25 per cent in the FCT to be declared the winner.        
There is no gainsaying that in any country where people’s votes count, popular candidates win elections. It is only in countries where people trust in rigging that they tell you that you need a “structure” to win an election.
When Barack Obama joined the presidential race for the United States in 2007, I saw the type of excitement he evoked in people and predicted from far away Nigeria that he would win the presidency. But political pundits told me that it was impossible for him to do so, given his racial identity and lack of “political structure.” His opponents in the Democratic Party mocked him as a neophyte. But he eventually won his party’s ticket and the presidential election.
Similarly, when Donald Trump emerged in 2015 and was creating excitement, I said he would win the presidency, but political pundits told me that a man with such a foul mouth and unpredictable behaviour could not win the American presidency. He eventually won it.
As long as elections are completely transparent and determined by popularity, the much-touted political structure (read “vote buying, thuggery, intimidation, and election manipulation”) credited to some strong men and women is hollow. In a true democracy, the people’s vote (and not political structure) wins elections.

"Sanwo-Olu: Seeking re-election on experience, track record","The decision of the Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to seek a second term in office came as no surprise to many Lagosians, in that the constitution of land permits him to do so. But the move, no doubt, was greeted by spontaneous excitement among the residents, given the quality of leadership, people-oriented policies and clear governance direction brought to the State by Sanwo-olu and his brother, Deputy Governor Obafemi Hamzat.
Little wonder Mobolaji Johnson Arena in Onikan literally became a beehive on Saturday, December 3, 2022, when the All Progressives Congress inaugurated the governor’s re-election campaign.
Sanwo-Olu, an exemplary public sector reformer and astute politician, known for his love and passion for the public service, has shown leadership in Lagos by giving the electorate a great deal in steering the ship of the nation’s commercial city in the right direction.
As the 15th Lagos governor, and having worked closely with three previous governors – Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Babatunde Raji Fashola, and Akinwunmi Ambode in different capacities, Sanwo-Olu understands the state and the various challenges facing the mega city. His knowledge of challenges confronting residents made his administration adopt a six pillars policy programme tagged “T.H.E.M.E.S’’ in solving the identified problems through good governance. The six pillars are; Traffic Management and Transportation; Health and Environment; Education and Technology; Making Lagos a 21st Century state; Entertainment and Tourism; Security and Governance. Each of these six pillars is carefully thought-out as the government’s priorities in delivering solutions across sectors.
 
Sanwo-Olu, in his speech at the swearing-in on May 29, 2019, spoke passionately about his plans for the state, especially his dream of building a greater Lagos. This passion seemed to have motivated his quest for good governance. The governor, without any iota of doubt, has delivered significantly on his campaign promises during his first term in office. His achievements are visible in different sectors and have been commended by people within and outside the state.
A little above seven months when the Sanwo-Olu administration had barely settled down, COVID-19 pandemic ravaged the entire world and Lagos became an epicentre of the airborne disease. The governor showed leadership in rising up to the occasion and responding to the pandemic. As Incident Commander, he protected the citizens of the state by ensuring that the ravaging infection was well managed.
Sanwo-Olu, with the assistance of his Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, and other stakeholders controlled the spread and ensured that those who contracted the virus were well attended to. He was the first governor to come up with a clearly defined containment strategy and response, which was later adopted by the presidency for the national response plan.  This intervention by the Sanwo-Olu administration made Nigeria the fourth best country in the world which impressively curbed the spread of the COVID-19 virus according to the World Health Organisation.      
Sanwo-Olu also displayed great leadership during the #EndSARS demonstration, a youth-motivated civil action against police brutality, which was later hijacked by hoodlums. The campaign, which started peacefully, turned violent after it was hijacked, leading to violence and destruction of private and public property in Lagos State. Rather than allowing Lagos to be brought to its knees by the ugly incident, Sanwo-Olu rose up to the challenge by championing the “Rebuild Lagos” plan.
The administration’s traffic management and transportation blueprint has significantly brought the dream of Lagos to have an efficient and reliable intermodal system of transportation to a reality. Sanwo-Olu’ government has invested hugely in waterways and a light rail system as alternatives to road transportation.
The governor’s administration started the 37-km Red Line rail project from scratch and the project is at completion stage. At full operation, the Red Line will move about a million passengers daily. The administration also injected huge resources into the 13-km Blue Line rail, commissioned in January by the President, (Major General) Muhammadu Buhari (retd), to ensure mass mobility from Mile 2 axis into the Island.
To ease traffic gridlock in the metropolis, Sanwo-Olu’s administration built and completed Agege-Pen Cinema dual carriage flyover with adjoining roads in Agege, and also commissioned the Lagos-Ogun network of roads with bridge in Agbado-Oke Odo Local Council Development Area. He also carried out junction improvements and reconfiguration at the 18 traffic spots, including first and second Lekki Roundabouts, Allen Avenue, Ajah and Igando. All these are done to reduce traffic gridlock in the state.
In the last three and half years, the governor has constructed and rehabilitated over 1,000 roads while others are at various stages of completion. The plan for construction of the 4th Mainland Bridge is also on course. The incumbent administration also started the Opebi-Ojota Link Bridge, which is expected to be completed this year. The First phase of the six-lane rigid-pavement 18.75km Lekki-Epe Expressway, stretching from Eleko Junction all the way to Epe T-junction, is completed and delivered to the good people of Lagos residing in the Lekki-Epe axis. The Sanwo-Olu administration has also provided thousands of LAGRIDE cars, First and Last Mile buses, and large capacity buses and boats for waterways to ease transportation in Lagos.
Sanwo-Olu believes no resources should be spared in providing quality health care to the residents, which is why the state government delivered secondary health facilities, such as Mother and Child Centres in Eti-Osa, Igando, Epe and Badagry. The Lagos government is building New Massey Children Hospital, which will be the biggest children hospital in West Africa. There is also an ongoing construction of General Hospital in Ojo and development of a mental health facility in Ketu Ejinrin.

To address waste management and environmental issues in Lagos, the Sanwo-Olu administration is working hard to rid the state of flood. The state government has carried out extensive dredging and desilting on many secondary and tertiary drainage channels across the state.        
Sanwo-Olu’s administration has made a lot of investments in education and technology in Lagos by building thousands of classrooms and providing 380,000 units of composite furniture for the students. Among the iconic school projects built by the Sanwo-Olu government are the new Elemoro Community Junior Secondary School, Ibeju-Lekki, and the containerised modular classroom block in Vetland Junior Grammar School, Agege. The governor has also rewarded 13 outstanding teachers with new vehicles on two occasions.
The administration has equally made remarkable inroad in the training of teachers for 21st-century competence. It is of note that through the EKO EXCEL training initiative, more than 3,000 primary school teachers have been trained on how to competently utilise technology in teaching, for better educational outcomes for our children. The government has also paid the WAEC fees of all students in the state’s public secondary schools to date.
The Lagos State Polytechnic and Lagos State College of Education have been upgraded to universities. Lagos now has three state-owned universities, courtesy of Sanwo-Olu’s education reforms. It should be noted that there have been no disruption of academic activities across Lagos’ tertiary institutions since Sanwo-Olu took over; all issues that relate to students, staff and lecturers’ welfare are promptly attended to.
One of the cardinal programmes of the governor is making Lagos a 21st-century economy. In this regard, Sanwo-Olu has recorded a milestone in provision of requisite infrastructure. The recent handover of the Lekki Deep Seaport project is a pointer to this. Lagos has also secured an approval for the development of Badagry Port and an international airport in Lekki. All of these will boost Lagos’ economy when completed.
The governor has also made significant progress in the housing sector, as the administration commissioned over 7,000 flats in about 17 housing units in different parts of the state in the last three and half years, while more housing schemes are expected to be delivered in the coming months.
The Sanwo-Olu administration has done so much in the area of agriculture and food security, with initiatives such as the Agro Processing, Productivity Enhancement and Livelihood Improvement Support project, designed to build the capacity of players in the rice, aquaculture and poultry value chains. The government has also strengthened the capacity of farmers through the Lagos Agripreneurship Programme, the Sea Food Festival and the Eko City Farmers Food Market.
Above all, Sanwo-Olu has completed and delivered the all-important Lagos Rice Mill, Imota, Ikorodu. This rice mill will inject over 250,000 direct and indirect jobs into employment space for the youth.      
Safety is key for development. The governor recently commissioned three newly built fire stations and 62 fire fighting equipment. Sanwo-Olu has also made significant developments in entertainment and tourism, being the fifth pillar of his administration’s THEMES agenda. He has supported the creative industry across youth-centric initiatives, among which are the building of a film city and the release of N1bn seed capital to support the creative sector in Lagos.
As of today, over 3,000 youths have been trained and empowered by the Lagos State Government in partnership with the Africa Film Academy, Del-York Films Academy and EbonyLife Studios.
On security and governance, the administration’s goal is transformational security, using cutting-edge technology. To achieve this, the state government is building a Command-and-Control Centre to efficiently monitor security in the metropolis, while investing heavily in security cameras, data-gathering and processing in order to stay permanently ahead of crime and criminality.
Sanwo-Olu has made Lagos safe and secure through investment in security, which is the reason crime reduced drastically, making Lagos the safest state in Nigeria. The government’s decision to ban motorcycles and tricycles on highways and some roads within the state has also led to a reduction in accident victims in the state.
Sanwo-Olu has, without doubt, taken governance to a whole new level during his first term. Therefore, his re-election campaign has been based on his sterling performance and hands-on experience. He has delivered on many of his campaign promises and certainly deserves the vote of every forward-looking Lagosian who thinks more about the development of the state.

,"Little wonder Mobolaji Johnson Arena in Onikan literally became a beehive on Saturday, December 3, 2022, when the All Progressives Congress inaugurated the governor’s re-election campaign.
Sanwo-Olu, an exemplary public sector reformer and astute politician, known for his love and passion for the public service, has shown leadership in Lagos by giving the electorate a great deal in steering the ship of the nation’s commercial city in the right direction.
As the 15th Lagos governor, and having worked closely with three previous governors – Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Babatunde Raji Fashola, and Akinwunmi Ambode in different capacities, Sanwo-Olu understands the state and the various challenges facing the mega city. His knowledge of challenges confronting residents made his administration adopt a six pillars policy programme tagged “T.H.E.M.E.S’’ in solving the identified problems through good governance. The six pillars are; Traffic Management and Transportation; Health and Environment; Education and Technology; Making Lagos a 21st Century state; Entertainment and Tourism; Security and Governance. Each of these six pillars is carefully thought-out as the government’s priorities in delivering solutions across sectors.
 
Sanwo-Olu, in his speech at the swearing-in on May 29, 2019, spoke passionately about his plans for the state, especially his dream of building a greater Lagos. This passion seemed to have motivated his quest for good governance. The governor, without any iota of doubt, has delivered significantly on his campaign promises during his first term in office. His achievements are visible in different sectors and have been commended by people within and outside the state.
A little above seven months when the Sanwo-Olu administration had barely settled down, COVID-19 pandemic ravaged the entire world and Lagos became an epicentre of the airborne disease. The governor showed leadership in rising up to the occasion and responding to the pandemic. As Incident Commander, he protected the citizens of the state by ensuring that the ravaging infection was well managed.
Sanwo-Olu, with the assistance of his Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, and other stakeholders controlled the spread and ensured that those who contracted the virus were well attended to. He was the first governor to come up with a clearly defined containment strategy and response, which was later adopted by the presidency for the national response plan.  This intervention by the Sanwo-Olu administration made Nigeria the fourth best country in the world which impressively curbed the spread of the COVID-19 virus according to the World Health Organisation.      
Sanwo-Olu also displayed great leadership during the #EndSARS demonstration, a youth-motivated civil action against police brutality, which was later hijacked by hoodlums. The campaign, which started peacefully, turned violent after it was hijacked, leading to violence and destruction of private and public property in Lagos State. Rather than allowing Lagos to be brought to its knees by the ugly incident, Sanwo-Olu rose up to the challenge by championing the “Rebuild Lagos” plan.
The administration’s traffic management and transportation blueprint has significantly brought the dream of Lagos to have an efficient and reliable intermodal system of transportation to a reality. Sanwo-Olu’ government has invested hugely in waterways and a light rail system as alternatives to road transportation.
The governor’s administration started the 37-km Red Line rail project from scratch and the project is at completion stage. At full operation, the Red Line will move about a million passengers daily. The administration also injected huge resources into the 13-km Blue Line rail, commissioned in January by the President, (Major General) Muhammadu Buhari (retd), to ensure mass mobility from Mile 2 axis into the Island.
To ease traffic gridlock in the metropolis, Sanwo-Olu’s administration built and completed Agege-Pen Cinema dual carriage flyover with adjoining roads in Agege, and also commissioned the Lagos-Ogun network of roads with bridge in Agbado-Oke Odo Local Council Development Area. He also carried out junction improvements and reconfiguration at the 18 traffic spots, including first and second Lekki Roundabouts, Allen Avenue, Ajah and Igando. All these are done to reduce traffic gridlock in the state.

Protest rocks Kwara local football council election,"Some members of the Kwara State FA have protested their disqualification from the upcoming local football council elections, which will hold March 21, The PUNCH reports.
Following the order of the Nigeria Football Federation to state football associations to conduct elections into their respective local football councils as a prelude to the state elections, the Kwara FA constituted a committee headed by a former chairman, Saliu Ojibara.
However, four local councils — Asa, Ifelodun, Ilorin West and Moro — were allegedly prevented from the process due to non-payment of affiliation fees as well as incomplete electorate list, meaning that every aspirant from the local councils could not take part in the elections.
As a result, interim committees were sworn in on Sunday to take charge of the local councils and ensure all conditions for elections were met in 30 days, while elections into the other local councils would go on as scheduled.
 
One of the affected aspirants, who is currently the caretaker Chairman of Ilorin West Local Council, Yahaya Yar’adua, claimed he wasn’t aware of such payment.

In fact, we were not even told during the screening, we just read it on the group chat after we had gone for screening that our local football councils won’t participate in the elections,” Yar’adua said.
Another affected aspirant from Asa local council, Ibraheem Ajao, noted that the moves were all schemes of the current Kwara FA chairman to ensure his return for a second term.      
“All the four local councils that are affected are the ones the chairman knows won’t support his second term.”
Chairman of the electoral committee, Saliu Ojibara, noted that the body followed the electoral guidelines during the process that led to the disqualification of the councils.
“This is the first time we are having local council elections and we are applying the electoral guidelines which is available for all the members.

"February elections consolidated Nigeria’s democracy, Presidency replies critics","The Presidency on Monday evening said the Presidential and National Assembly elections of February 25 has consolidated Nigeria’s democracy and improved the integrity of the Electoral Act 2022.
It also argued that as much as international observers faulted the irregularities witnessed in the collation of results, due credit must be given to the efforts of the Buhari regime to ensure free and fair polls.
“Though it is true there were some delays and technical faults in the process that we can learn from – as is the case in any election the world over – the vote progressed and consolidated democracy in Nigeria,” a statement signed by the President’s spokesman, Garba Shehu, read late Monday.
The statement is titled ‘February 25 presidential election is a marked improvement on past elections, the world should note this.’

Elections: Army condemns ‘smear campaign’ against officers,"The Nigerian Army has denied a report that some of its senior officers were partisan during the February 25 presidential and National Assembly elections. 
The Army said contrary to the “smear campaign”, its officers rather ensured a peaceful election free from interference by ill-motivated groups.
A report by a media outlet (not The PUNCH) claimed that the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, had conspired with a General who ordered the deployment of troops to some locations in Lagos for the election to be rigged in favour of the Labour Party. 
In a swift reaction on Monday, the Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, claimed some interest groups that the service prevented from influencing the elections through violence were behind the report. 
 
It partly read, “The attention of the Nigerian Army has been drawn to a deliberately calculated smear campaign in the Social Media and other fora against some of our senior commanders and officers. While these unconscionable acts are inexplicable, the motivation behind them are not far-fetched. 
“In the just concluded presidential and National Assembly elections, officers and men of the Nigerian Army adopted a firm and resolute stance in providing security support for the elections in a manner that effectively curbed and prevented ill-intentioned groups from violently interfering with the process.

“As constitutionally conceived, the Nigerian Army is nationalistic in its make-up and organisation, drawing strengths from the diversities in our great nation.

NASS: APC to zone offices after governorship election,"Newly elected lawmakers on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, on Monday, in Abuja, said the party would zone principal offices only after the conclusion of the governorship election holding on Saturday, March 18.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, amongst other lawmakers-elect, disclosed this to our correspondent after a meeting between the Senators-elect and House of Representatives members-elect and the party leadership held at the Banquet Hall of the State House, Abuja.
The meeting, which comes barely two weeks after the February 25 presidential and National Assembly elections, is the first between the newly-elected members of parliament and the party.
It followed rife speculations that the APC would use the medium to speedily zone principal offices in the two chambers of the 10th National Assembly to avert a repeat of the 2015 scenario where the party lost grip of the legislature despite retaining the most number of seats in both chambers.
 
However, the Speaker of the House, Gbajabiamila, told our correspondent that the conversation did not entail any discussion about the NASS leadership because the elections were not over.
After the meeting, he said, “On the issue of zoning, we did not talk about it because we’re not there yet. We have an election coming up this weekend. And we need to ensure everybody goes back home, rolls up their sleeves and gets their hands dirty.

“We’re not there yet so we need to complete the victory before we start talking about the leadership of the National Assembly. The reason we didn’t discuss zoning is because we all agreed to tarry for a while until we finish the elections.”
A Senator representing Niger East Senatorial District and former contender for the APC chairmanship at the March 2022 primaries, Mohammed Musa, argued that discussing zoning at the first encounter would be premature as the party needed to consolidate its victory at the state levels.
That consolidation would mean the APC clinching the governorship offices in 30 states.
Musa said, “This is not the right time to discuss zoning. All we need now is to consolidate our victory. We have won the presidential election and we should be able to take at least 30 states.
“After the governorship election, we are going to gather again and by then we’ll take stock of what we have achieved and then the zoning system that the party wants to adopt will be announced to us. We have all agreed that all members will go with what the party decides.”
On his part, Senator Mohammed Ndume, who will represent Borno South in the 10th NASS, said the party leadership urged the lawmakers-elect to shelve their ambitions in the meantime and deliver their states to the APC come March 18.
“The party appealed to NASS members-elect to play down the leadership issues and focus more on ensuring that we take the election battle to the end. And that is to ensure that we win our states,” Ndume noted.",0.08947725554868412,Positive,"FILE: A cross-section of parliamentarians during the presentation of the 2021 Appropriation Bill by President Muhammadu Buhari to a joint session of the National Assembly in Abuja on Thursday (8/10/20).

Clark declared his blessing on Pela during a courtesy visit to the candidate at his residence in Abuja on Monday.

He said, “The chances of the Labour Party are very bright in Delta and I am sure that we are all aware that in the last election, the PDP, the ruling party in Delta, was beaten for the first time by an opposition party.
“This election circle is different, power resides with the people. Our chances are very bright because we believe the people are solidly behind us. We will win this election fair and square.
“We did not have any fear going into the last election; we felt with the new Electoral Act and BVAS, there was no fear and INEC promised us several times, but they did certain things that we did not expect.
“They acted with impunity, and contrary to the law, they did not transmit the results as they were supposed to. We will not let that happen again. We are prepared for them this time.",0.3255377955377955,Positive,,
